##### Learn how to activate your windows 10 by phone

Phone activation is reported to have proved its worth as an effective fix for the error 0x803F7001.

To activate your Win 10 by phone, follow these steps:

1. Windows logo key + R -> Type ‘Slui 4’ into the Run box -> Enter
2. Select your Country/Region from the list -> Next
3. You will be given a toll-free phone number -> Use this number to get your confirmation ID -> Activate
